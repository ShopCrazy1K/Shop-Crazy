# 🎯 You're Almost There!

## Current Location:

### Where to Find It:

- You should see:
  - General ← You are here
  - **Database** ← Click this!
  - API
  - Auth
  - Storage
  - etc.

**Option 2: Tabs at Top**

## Once You Click Database:

Scroll down the page and look for:
- **"Connection string"** section
- **"Connection info"** section
- **"Connection pooling"** section
- Any section showing database connection details

The connection string will be in a section with tabs like:
- **URI** ← This is what you want!
- Transaction mode
- Session mode

**Can't find Database in Settings?** 

We can build the connection string manually - I just need your database password!
