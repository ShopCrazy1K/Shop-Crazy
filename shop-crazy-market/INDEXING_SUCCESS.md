# ✅ Indexing Request Successful!

## What You Just Saw

**Message:** "URL was added to a priority crawl queue. Submitting a page multiple times will not change its queue position or priority"

**Translation:** ✅ **You did it perfectly!** Google received your request and your homepage is now in line to be crawled with priority.

## What This Means

1. ✅ **Your request was successful** - Google received it
2. ✅ **Priority queue** - Your page will be crawled faster than normal
3. ✅ **Favicon will be picked up** - When Google crawls, it will see your new favicon
4. ✅ **No need to resubmit** - Multiple requests won't help (you're already queued)

## What Happens Next

### Timeline:

**Within 24-48 hours:**
- Google crawls your homepage
- Picks up your favicon files
- Updates the page in their index

**Within 1 week:**
- Your homepage appears in search results with updated info
- Other pages from your sitemap start getting indexed

**Within 1-2 weeks:**
- Favicon may start appearing in Google search results
- Search for: `site:shopcrazymarket.com` to see it

**Within 2-6 weeks:**
- Favicon fully updated across all search results
- Complete indexing of all pages from sitemap

## How to Monitor Progress

### 1. Check URL Inspection (After 24-48 hours)

1. Go to **URL Inspection** in Google Search Console
2. Enter: `https://shopcrazymarket.com`
3. Look for:
   - **"Last crawl"** date (should update after crawling)
   - **"Indexing requested"** status (may change to "Indexed")

### 2. Check Coverage Report

1. Go to **"Coverage"** in left sidebar
2. After 24-48 hours, your homepage should show:
   - Status: **"Valid"** (indexed successfully)
   - No errors

### 3. Check Sitemap Status

1. Go to **"Sitemaps"** in left sidebar
2. Watch **"Indexed URLs"** increase over time
3. Should go from 0 → increasing numbers as pages get indexed

### 4. Search for Your Site

After 1-2 weeks:
- Search: `site:shopcrazymarket.com`
- Look for your favicon next to search results
- If not showing, wait longer (Google caches favicons aggressively)
