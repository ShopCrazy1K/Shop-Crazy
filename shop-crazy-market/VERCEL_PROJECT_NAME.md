# Vercel Project Name - What to Use

## Recommended Project Name

When importing your project in Vercel, you can use:

**Option 1: Keep Default (Recommended)**
- Vercel will suggest: `shop-crazy-market` or `Shop-Crazy`
- ✅ This matches your repository name
- ✅ Easy to identify
- ✅ No changes needed

**Option 2: Custom Name**
- You can change it to anything you want
- Examples:
  - `shopcrazymarket`
  - `shop-crazy`
  - `crazy-market`
- ✅ Doesn't affect functionality
- ✅ Just for organization in Vercel dashboard

## What Matters

The project name in Vercel is **just for organization**. It doesn't affect:
- ❌ Your domain (you set that separately)
- ❌ Your GitHub repository
- ❌ Your code
- ❌ Your deployments

## Your Domain

Your actual website domain is set separately:
- If you have a custom domain: `shopcrazymarket.com`
- Vercel will also give you: `your-project.vercel.app`

## Recommendation

**Keep the default name** that Vercel suggests (`shop-crazy-market` or `Shop-Crazy`). It's:
- ✅ Clear and descriptive
- ✅ Matches your repo
- ✅ Easy to find in dashboard

You can always rename it later in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → General → Project Name.

## Summary

**No, you don't need to change it.** The default is fine! Just focus on:
1. ✅ Connecting the repository
2. ✅ Setting environment variables (especially DATABASE_URL)
3. ✅ Clicking Deploy

The project name is the least important part of the setup.
