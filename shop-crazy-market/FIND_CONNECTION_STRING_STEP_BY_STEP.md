# 📍 Step-by-Step: Find Connection String

## You're Currently In:
**Database** section (left sidebar)

## What You Need To Do:

### Step 1: Go to Project Settings
1. Look at the **left sidebar** (where you see Database, Authentication, Storage, etc.)
2. Scroll down or look for **"Settings"** (⚙️ gear icon) - this is different from Database → Settings
3. Click **"Settings"** (the main project settings, not Database → Settings)

### Step 2: Click Database
1. In Settings, you'll see options like:
   - General
   - **Database** ← Click this!
   - API
   - Auth
   - Storage
   - etc.

### Step 3: Find Connection String
1. Scroll down the Database settings page
2. Look for:
   - **"Connection string"** section
   - **"Connection info"** section  
   - **"Connection pooling"** section
   - Any section with connection details

### Alternative: Try API Settings
If you don't see it in Database settings:
1. Still in **Settings** (main sidebar)
2. Click **"API"** instead
3. Look for **"Database URL"** or connection string there

## Visual Guide:

```
Left Sidebar:
├── Table Editor
├── Authentication
├── Database ← You are here
├── Storage
├── ...
└── Settings ← GO HERE INSTEAD! (gear icon at bottom)
    ├── General
    ├── Database ← Then click this
    ├── API
    └── ...
```

This should take you directly to the Database settings page where the connection string should be.

## Still Can't Find It?

If the connection string section isn't visible, we can:
1. **Build it manually** (I have your project info, just need password)
2. **Use the connection pooling URL** (alternative method)
3. **Check if your project is fully set up** (might need to wait a bit)

Let me know what you see on the Settings → Database page!
